        <h1>So, you want to know about Allen Henderson?</h1>
        
        <p>I am a 22 year old guy that loves to make websites for people. If you are still not convinced that this is what I love to do, then you may ask all my teachers from middle and high school. They will tell you the same thing.</p>
        
        <h2>Let me tell you how web developing all started to become my field of interest</h2>
        
        <p>When I was much younger, I loved playing on the computer and using the internet. I finally figured out that people, my age, were creating websites. I found online website builders. However, those website builders had these plans that were ridiculous. What I mean by that is, their plans were like cell phone company plans. Then I finally figured out you can code them yourself. My first though was, "I know I can learn that." When I was in high school, I took computer classes all throughout high school. I loved it. There was this one class called "Multimedia Publishing" where we pretty much did a newscast. I was having so much fun with it. I realized that I loved web development. With that being said, I am going back to school to get my certification in it.</p>
            
        <p>In the meantime, I am also planning on making more websites from scratch to help build my portfolio. With that being said, if you do not see what you are looking for, I am most likely either planning on it or already working on that template.</p>
